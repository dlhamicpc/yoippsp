<h3><a id="6" name="6" pa-marked="1"></a>6.&nbsp;How Do We Work with Other Services and Platforms?<strong>&nbsp; </strong></h3> <p>A significant benefit and innovation of PayPal’s Services is that you can connect your Account with a third-party account or platform. &nbsp;For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, an “account connection” with such a third-party is a connection you authorize or enable between your Account and a non-PayPal account, payment instrument, or platform that you lawfully control or own.&nbsp; When you authorize such a connection, PayPal and the third-party will exchange your Personal Data and other information directly.&nbsp; Examples of account connections include:</p> <ul> <li>linking your Account to a social media account or social messaging service;</li> <li>connecting your Account to a third-party data aggregation or financial services company, if you provide such company with your Account log-in credentials; or</li> <li>using your Account to make payments to a merchant or allowing a merchant to charge your Account.</li> </ul> <p>If you choose to create an account connection, we may receive information from the third-party about you and your use of the third-party’s service.&nbsp; For example, if you connect your Account to a social media account, we will receive Personal Data from the social media provider via the account connection.&nbsp; If you connect your Account to other financial accounts, directly or through a third-party service provider, we may have access to your account balance and transactional information, such as purchases and funds transfers. &nbsp;We will use all such information that we receive from a third-party via an account connection in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement.&nbsp;</p> <p>Information that we share with a third-party based on an account connection will be used and disclosed in accordance with the third-party’s privacy practices.&nbsp; Before authorizing an account connection, you should review the privacy notice of any third-party that will gain access to your Personal Data as part of the account connection.&nbsp; For example, Personal Data that PayPal shares with a third-party account or platform such as a social media account may in turn be shared with certain other parties, including the general public, depending on the account’s or platform’s privacy practices.&nbsp;</p>
