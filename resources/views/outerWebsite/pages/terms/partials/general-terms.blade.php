PayPal is not acting as a trustee, fiduciary or escrow with respect to your funds, but is acting only as an agent to you and custodian to your funds. PayPal does not have control of, nor liability for, the products or services that are paid for with the PayPal Services. We do not guarantee the identity of any User or ensure that a buyer or a Seller will complete a transaction.</p> <p><strong>13.3 No Warranty.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>THE PAYPAL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION OF WARRANTY, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY. PAYPAL, OUR PARENT AND AFFILIATES, OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, JOINT VENTURES, EMPLOYEES AND OUR SUPPLIERS SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.&nbsp;</strong>PayPal does not have any control over the products or services that are paid for with the PayPal Services and PayPal cannot ensure that a buyer or a Seller you are dealing with will actually complete the transaction or is authorized to do so. PayPal does not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted or secure access to any part of the PayPal Services, and operation of our site may be temporarily suspended for maintenance or upgrade or interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control. PayPal will make reasonable efforts to ensure that requests for electronic debits and credits involving bank accounts, credit cards, and check issuances are processed in a timely manner but PayPal makes no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to complete processing because the PayPal Services are dependent upon many factors outside of our control, such as delays in the banking system or mail service.
