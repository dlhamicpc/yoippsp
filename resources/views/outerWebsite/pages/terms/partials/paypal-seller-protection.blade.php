If you originally ship the item to the recipient address but the item is later redirected to a different address, you will not be eligible for PayPal Seller Protection. We therefore recommend not using a shipping service that is arranged by the buyer, so that you will be able to provide valid proof of shipping and delivery.</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">Donations.</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">Financial products and investments.</li> </ul>
