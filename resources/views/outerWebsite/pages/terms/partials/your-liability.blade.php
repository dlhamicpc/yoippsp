 <h3><a name="11" pa-marked="1"></a>11. Your Liability - Actions We May Take.</h3> <p><strong>11.1 Your Liability.</strong></p> <p style="margin-left:24pt;">a.&nbsp;<strong>General.</strong>&nbsp;You are responsible for all Reversals, Chargebacks, Claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liability incurred by PayPal, a User, or a third party caused by or arising out of your breach of this Agreement, and/or your use of the PayPal Services. You agree to reimburse PayPal, a User, or a third party for any and all such liability.</p> <p style="margin-left:24pt;">b.&nbsp;<strong>Liability for Claims under PayPal Buyer Protection.</strong>&nbsp;If you are a Seller and you lose a Claim filed directly with PayPal, you will be required to reimburse PayPal for your liability. Where you receive payment from a PayPal Account holder in another country/region&nbsp;and we determine under the Buyer Protection policy of that country/region&nbsp;that the funds received should be returned or reversed, you will be required to reimburse PayPal for your liability (before receiving payment from a PayPal Account holder in another country/region, you should review the relevant PayPal Buyer Protection policies available&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paypal.com/et/webapps/mpp/ua/ua-table" pa-marked="1"><strong>here</strong></a>). Your liability will include the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost (and in some cases you may not receive the item back), and the PayPal Fees that you were charged for the transaction. PayPal Seller Protection will cover your liability for eligible Claims based on Item not Received, and eligible Unauthorized Transactions - see Section 9 (PayPal Seller Protection) above.<br> <br> If a buyer files a Significantly Not as Described (SNAD) Claim for an item he or she purchased from you, you will generally be required to accept the item back and refund the buyer the full purchase price plus original shipping costs. You will not receive a refund on your PayPal Fees. Further, if you lose a SNAD Claim because we, in our sole discretion, reasonably believe the item you sold is counterfeit, you will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you might not receive the item back from the buyer (for instance, it may be disposed of or otherwise irreversibly dealt with). PayPal Seller Protection will not cover your liability for SNAD Claims.</p> <p style="margin-left:24pt;">c.&nbsp;<strong>Liability for claims filed under eBay’s Money Back Guarantee program.</strong>&nbsp;If you are an eBay Seller and eBay makes a final decision pursuant to its eBay Money Back Guarantee program holding you liable to reimburse the buyer, then you authorize PayPal to remove funds from your Account in an amount not greater than the amount of such claim and remit such funds to eBay.</p> <p style="margin-left:24pt;">d.&nbsp;<strong>Liability for instructions given by you on your Account.</strong>&nbsp;Any instructions given by you on your Account (whether verbal or in writing) once you have been authenticated will be relied on by PayPal. PayPal will not be liable for any loss or damage you or anyone else suffers where PayPal acts on those instructions in good faith, unless it was proved that PayPal was negligent.</p> <p><strong>11.2 Reimbursement for Your Liability.</strong>&nbsp;In the event that you are liable for any amounts owed to PayPal, PayPal may immediately remove such amounts from your balance. If you do not have a balance that is sufficient to cover your liability, your remaining balance (if any) will be removed, your Account will have negative balance up to the amount of your liability, and you will be required to immediately Add Money to your PayPal balance or reimburse PayPal through an alternative method. If you do not do so, PayPal may engage in collection efforts to recover such amounts from you.</p> <p><strong>11.3 Actions by PayPal – Restricted Activities.</strong>&nbsp;If PayPal, in its sole discretion, believes that you may have engaged in any Restricted Activities, we may take various actions to protect PayPal, Affiliates other Users, other third parties or you from Reversals, Chargebacks, Claims, fees, fines, penalties and any other liability. The actions we may take include but are not limited to the following:</p> <ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">We may close, suspend, or limit your access to your Account or the PayPal Services;</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">We may suspend your eligibility for PayPal Buyer Protection and/or PayPal Seller Protection;</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">We may hold, apply or transfer the funds in your Account as required by judgments and orders which&nbsp;affect you or your Account, including judgments and orders&nbsp;issued by courts in Singapore or elsewhere and directed to PayPal or its Affiliates;</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">We may refuse to provide the PayPal Services to you now and in the future; and</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">We may hold your funds for a period of time reasonably needed to protect against the risk of liability to PayPal or a third party, or if we believe that you may be engaging in potentially fraudulent or suspicious activity and/or transactions.</li> </ol> <p><strong>11.4 Actions by PayPal - Holds.</strong></p> <ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;"><strong>Risk-Based Holds.</strong>&nbsp;PayPal, in its sole discretion, may place a hold on any or all of the payments you receive when PayPal believes there may be a high level of risk associated with you, your Account, or any or all of your transactions. PayPal’s determination may be based on different factors and PayPal may rely on information it receives from third parties. If PayPal places a hold on a payment, the funds will appear as pending balance or withheld and the payment status will indicate the hold. If PayPal places a hold on any or all of the payments you receive, PayPal will provide you with notice of our actions. PayPal will release the hold on any payment after 30 Days from the date the payment was received into your Account unless PayPal has a reason to continue to hold the payment such as (a) the receipt of a Dispute, Claim, Chargeback, or Reversal, (b) PayPal believes that you have violated the terms of this Agreement or any other Policy and that such a violation results in the need to continue holding the funds, or (c) PayPal believes that you may be engaging in potentially fraudulent or suspicious activity and/or transactions. In such an event, PayPal may continue holding the payment in your Account until the matter is resolved pursuant to this Agreement. PayPal, in its sole discretion, may release the hold earlier under certain circumstances, for example when you upload tracking information of the item you shipped.</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;"><strong>Disputed Transaction Holds.</strong>&nbsp;If a User files a Dispute, Claim, Chargeback or Reversal on a payment you received, PayPal may place a temporary hold on the funds in your Account to cover the amount of the liability. If you win the dispute or the transaction is eligible for PayPal Seller Protection, PayPal will lift the temporary hold. If you lose the dispute, PayPal will remove the funds from your Account. This process also applies to any claim that a buyer files directly with eBay through the eBay Money Back Guarantee program, provided that your Account is your reimbursement method for amounts you owe to eBay or to the buyer (as the case may be) under the terms of the eBay Money Back Guarantee program.</li> </ol> <p><strong>11.5 Actions by PayPal - Reserves.</strong></p> <p>PayPal, in its sole discretion, may place a Reserve on funds held in your Business Account when PayPal believes there may be a high level of risk associated with your Account or your use of any of the products and/or services offered by PayPal and/or its Affiliates. If PayPal places a Reserve in your Account, transactions will be shown as "pending" in your PayPal balance, and you will not have access to funds in a “pending” status until they are cleared. If your Account is subject to a Reserve, PayPal will provide you with notice specifying the terms of the Reserve. The terms may require that a certain percentage of the amounts received into your Account are held for a certain period of time, or that a certain amount of money is held in Reserve, or anything else that PayPal determines is necessary to protect against the risk associated with your Account. PayPal may change the terms of the Reserve at any time by providing you with notice of the new terms.</p> <p><strong>11.6 Actions by PayPal - Account Closure, Termination of Service, Limited Account Access; Confidential Criteria.</strong>&nbsp;PayPal, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to terminate this Agreement and/or access to the PayPal Services for any reason and at any time upon notice and payment to you of any unrestricted funds held in your balance. If we limit access to your Account, including through a Reserve or hold, we will provide you with notice of our actions, and the opportunity to request restoration of access if, in our sole discretion, we deem it appropriate. Further, you acknowledge that PayPal’s decision to take certain actions, including limiting access to your Account, placing holds or imposing Reserves, may be based on confidential criteria that is essential to our management of risk, the security of Users’ Accounts and the PayPal system. You agree that PayPal is under no obligation to disclose the details of its risk management or its security procedures to you.</p> <p><strong>11.7 Acceptable Use Policy Violations.</strong>&nbsp;If you violate the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paypal.com/et/webapps/mpp/ua/acceptableuse-full" pa-marked="1"><strong>Acceptable Use Policy</strong></a>&nbsp;then in addition to the above actions you will be liable to PayPal for the amount of PayPal’s damages for each violation of the Acceptable Use Policy. You agree that $2,500.00 USD (or equivalent) per transaction in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy is presently a reasonable minimum estimate of PayPal’s actual damages considering all currently existing circumstances, including the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to PayPal that reasonably could be anticipated because due to the nature of the violations of the Acceptable Use Policy, actual damages would be impractical or extremely difficult to calculate. PayPal may deduct such damages directly from any existing balance in the offending Account, or any other Account you control.</p> <p>11.8 Compliance with Data Protection Laws<font color="#0782c1">.</font>&nbsp;With regard to any personal data processed by either Party in connection with this Agreement, the Parties will respectively each be a controller in respect of such processing. Each Party agrees to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Laws applicable to controllers in respect of the provision of the Company Services and otherwise in connection with this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, PayPal and the Merchant each have their own, independently determined privacy policies, notices and procedures for the personal data they hold and are each a data controller (and not joint data controllers).</p> <p>11.9 In complying with the Data Protection Laws, each Party shall, without limitation:</p> <ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"> <li>implement and maintain at all times all appropriate security measures in relation to the processing of personal data;</li> <li>maintain a record of all processing activities carried out under this Agreement; and</li> <li>not knowingly do anything or permit anything to be done which might lead to a breach by the other Party of the Data Protection Laws.</li> </ol> <div> <div> <div id="_com_1">&nbsp;</div> </div> </div>
