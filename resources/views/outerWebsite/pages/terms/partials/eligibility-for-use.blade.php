<h3><a name="3" pa-marked="1"></a>3. Eligibility for Use.</h3> <p><strong>3.1 Ability to Receive Payments.</strong>&nbsp;The ability to receive payments varies by country/region. To determine whether you have the ability to receive payments,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paypal.com/et/webapps/mpp/ua/residence-full" pa-marked="1"><strong>click here</strong></a>.</p> <p>PayPal may allow anybody (with or without a PayPal Account) to initiate a payment to your Business Account. By integrating into your online checkout/platform any functionality intended to enable a payer without an Account to send a payment to your Business Account, you agree to all further terms of use of that functionality which PayPal will make available to you on any page on the PayPal or Braintree website (including any page for developers and our <a href="https://www.paypal.com/et/webapps/mpp/ua/legalhub-full" pa-marked="1">Legal Agreements</a> page) or online platform. Such further terms include the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/et/webapps/mpp/ua/lpm-tnc" pa-marked="1">PayPal Local Payment Methods Agreement</a>.</p> <p><strong>3.2 Automatic Transfer Countries.</strong>&nbsp;If you are a resident of an Automatic Transfer Country, then you have the ability to receive payments but you must withdraw the full amount of your payment through an available withdrawal method. If you do not do so, the amounts will be automatically withdrawn from your Account to your withdrawal method on a regular basis. For additional terms regarding Automatic Transfer, please&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paypal.com/et/webapps/mpp/ua/recpymt-full" pa-marked="1"><strong>click here</strong></a>.</p> <p><strong>3.3 Liability for Invalidated Payments.</strong>&nbsp;When you receive a payment, you are liable to PayPal for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any Fees if the payment is later invalidated for any reason. This means that, in addition to any other liability, you will be responsible for the amount of the payment sent by the sender, plus the applicable Fees listed in Exhibit A (Fees) of this Agreement if you lose a Claim or a Chargeback, or if there is a Reversal of the payment.</p> <p>You agree to allow PayPal to recover any amounts due to PayPal by debiting your balance. If there are insufficient funds in your balance to cover your liability, you must reimburse PayPal through other means. If a sender of a payment files a Chargeback, the card issuer, not PayPal, will determine who wins the Chargeback.</p> <p><strong>3.4 No Surcharges</strong>. You agree that you will not impose a surcharge or any other fee for accepting PayPal as a payment method without our prior written consent. You may charge a handling fee in connection with the sale of goods or services, as long as the handling fee is not higher than the handling fee you charge for non-PayPal transactions.</p> <p><strong>3.5 Receiving Personal Payments.</strong>&nbsp;If you are selling goods or services, you may not ask the buyer to send you a Personal Payment for the purchase.</p> <p><strong>3.6 Preapproved Payments and/or No Log-In Payments.</strong>&nbsp;If you receive Preapproved Payments and/or No Log-In Payments you must receive your buyer’s Authorization to the payment amount, frequency and duration prior to submitting the payment.</p> <p><strong>3.7 Micropayments for Digital Goods.</strong>&nbsp;To qualify to receive Micropayments for Digital Goods, you must submit an application, be approved by us, and have an Account in good standing. By applying for Micropayments for Digital Goods, you agree that for Digital Goods transactions you receive up to the amounts in the table below, then if a buyer opens a Dispute, PayPal may reverse the transaction, and remove the funds from your Account without requiring the buyer to escalate the Dispute to a Claim.</p> <table border="1" class="ua_table"> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Currency</strong></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>Amount</strong></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>Currency</strong></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>Amount</strong></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Australian Dollar:</p> </td> <td> <p>$9.99 AUD&nbsp;</p> </td> <td> <p>New Zealand Dollar:</p> </td> <td> <p>$9.99 NZD</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Brazilian Real:</p> </td> <td> <p>R$7.99 BRL&nbsp;</p> </td> <td> <p>Norwegian Krone:</p> </td> <td> <p>29.99 NOK&nbsp;</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Canadian Dollar:</p> </td> <td> <p>$3.99 CAD&nbsp;</p> </td> <td> <p>Philippine Peso:</p> </td> <td> <p>499.99 PHP&nbsp;</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Czech Koruna:</p> </td> <td> <p>99.00 CZK&nbsp;</p> </td> <td> <p>Polish Zlotych:</p> </td> <td> <p>19.99 PLN&nbsp;</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Danish Krone:</p> </td> <td> <p>24.99 DKK&nbsp;</p> </td> <td> <p>Singapore Dollar:</p> </td> <td> <p>$9.99 SGD&nbsp;</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Euro:</p> </td> <td> <p>3.99 EUR&nbsp;</p> </td> <td> <p>Swedish Krona:</p> </td> <td> <p>34.99 SEK&nbsp;</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Hong Kong Dollar:</p> </td> <td> <p>$49.99 HKD&nbsp;</p> </td> <td> <p>Swiss Franc:</p> </td> <td> <p>4.99 CHF&nbsp;</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Hungarian Forint:</p> </td> <td> <p>999.00 HUF&nbsp;</p> </td> <td> <p>Taiwan New Dollar:</p> </td> <td> <p>249.00 TWD&nbsp;</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Israeli New Shekel:</p> </td> <td> <p>15.99 ILS&nbsp;</p> </td> <td> <p>Thai Baht:</p> </td> <td> <p>249.99 THB&nbsp;</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Japanese Yen:</p> </td> <td> <p>¥999.00 JPY&nbsp;</p> </td> <td> <p>U.K. Pound Sterling:</p> </td> <td> <p>£3.99 GBP&nbsp;</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Mexican Peso:</p> </td> <td> <p>$39.99 MXN&nbsp;</p> </td> <td> <p>U.S. Dollar:</p> </td> <td> <p>$3.99 USD&nbsp;</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table>
