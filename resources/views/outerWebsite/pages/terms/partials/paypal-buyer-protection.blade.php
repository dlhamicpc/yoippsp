 <h3><a name="7" pa-marked="1"></a>7. PayPal Buyer Protection.</h3> <p><strong>7.1 Types of Problems Covered.</strong>&nbsp;PayPal Buyer Protection helps you if you encounter either of these problems:</p> <ul> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;"><strong>"Item Not Received"</strong>&nbsp;(INR): You did not receive the item you paid for with PayPal; or</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;"><strong>"Significantly Not as Described"</strong>&nbsp;(SNAD) You received an item you paid for with PayPal but it is Significantly Not as Described (SNAD).</li> </ul> <p style="margin-left:24pt;">If your problem is a transaction that you did not authorize, please see section 8 below.</p> <p>An item is "Significantly Not as Described" (SNAD) if it is materially different from what the Seller described on its website or in the item listing. Here are some examples:</p> <ul> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">You received a completely different item. For example, you purchased a book and received a DVD or an empty box.</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">The condition of the item was misrepresented. For example, the description when you bought the item said “new” and the item was used.</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">The item was advertised as authentic but is not authentic.</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">The item is missing major parts or features which were not disclosed in its description when you bought the item.</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">You purchased three items from a Seller but only received two.</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">The item was materially damaged during shipment.</li> </ul> <p>An item is&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;Significantly Not as Described (SNAD) if it is materially similar to the Seller's item listing description. Here are some examples:</p> <ul> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">The defect in the item was correctly described by the Seller.</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">The item was properly described but you didn't want it after you received it.</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">The item was properly described but did not meet your expectations.</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">The item has minor scratches and was listed as used condition.</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">The item was listed as used condition and you picked it up in person after examining the item.</li> </ul> <p><strong>7.2 Eligibility Requirements.</strong></p> <p style="margin-left:24pt;">a.

If you do not escalate the Dispute to a Claim within 20 Days, PayPal will permanently close the Dispute.</p> <ul> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;"><strong>Respond to PayPal's requests for information in a timely manner</strong>. During the Claim process, PayPal may require you to provide documentation or other information. You may be asked to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports, or anything else that PayPal specifies.</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;"><strong>Comply with PayPal's shipping requests in a timely manner</strong>. For Significantly Not as Described (SNAD) Claims, PayPal will generally require you, at your expense, to ship the item back to the Seller, or to PayPal, or to a third party and to provide proof of delivery.</li> </ul> <p style="margin-left:24pt;">For transactions that total less than $250 USD (or the equivalent in other currencies as listed below), proof of delivery is confirmation that can be viewed online and includes the delivery address showing at least city/state or postal code, delivery date, and the URL to the shipping company’s website if you’ve selected “Other” in the shipping drop down menu. For transactions that total $250 USD or more (or the equivalent in other currencies as listed in the table below), you must also get a signature confirmation of the delivery (except for buyers having a PayPal Account registered: in Albania, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Iceland, Israel, or Ukraine to whom such requirement won’t apply).<br> <br> $250 USD signature confirmation requirement – other currencies equivalents:</p> <table border="1" class="ua_table"> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>Currency</strong></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>Amount</strong></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>Currency</strong></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>Amount</strong></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Australian Dollar:</p> </td> <td> <p>$350 AUD</p> </td> <td> <p>New Zealand Dollar:</p> </td> <td> <p>$380 NZD</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Brazilian Real:</p> </td> <td> <p>R$500 BRL</p> </td> <td> <p>Norwegian Krone:</p> </td> <td> <p>1,600 NOK</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Canadian Dollar:</p> </td> <td> <p>$325 CAD</p> </td> <td> <p>Philippine Peso:</p> </td> <td> <p>12,500 PHP</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Czech Republic Koruna:</p> </td> <td> <p>6,000 CZK</p> </td> <td> <p>Polish New Zloty:</p> </td> <td> <p>800 PLN</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Danish Krone:</p> </td> <td> <p>1,500 DKK</p> </td> <td> <p>Russian Ruble:</p> </td> <td> <p>8,500 RUB</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Euro:</p> </td> <td> <p>200 EUR</p> </td> <td> <p>Singapore Dollar:</p> </td> <td> <p>$400 SGD</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Hong Kong Dollar:</p> </td> <td> <p>$2,000 HKD</p> </td> <td> <p>Swedish Krona:</p> </td> <td> <p>2,000 SEK</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Hungarian Forint:</p> </td> <td> <p>55,000 HUF</p> </td> <td> <p>Swiss Franc:</p> </td> <td> <p>330 CHF</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Israeli New Shekel:</p> </td> <td> <p>1,000 ILS</p> </td> <td> <p>Taiwan New Dollar:</p> </td> <td> <p>8,250 TWD</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Japanese Yen:</p> </td> <td> <p>¥28,000 JPY</p> </td> <td> <p>Thai Baht:</p> </td> <td> <p>9,000 THB</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Malaysian Ringgit:</p> </td> <td> <p>1,000 MYR</p> </td> <td>U.K. Pound Sterling:</td> <td>£150 GBP</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Mexican Peso:</p> </td> <td> <p>$2,200 MX</p> </td> <td> <p>U.S. Dollar:</p> </td> <td> <p>$250.00 USD</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <ul> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;"><strong>Claim Resolution Process</strong>. Once a Dispute has been escalated to a Claim, PayPal will make a final decision in favor of the buyer or the Seller. You may be asked to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports, or anything else that PayPal specifies. PayPal retains full discretion to make a final decision in favor of the buyer or the Seller. In the event that PayPal makes a final decision in favor of the buyer or Seller, each party must comply with PayPal’s decision. PayPal will generally require the buyer to ship an item that the buyer claims is SNAD back to the Seller (at the buyer’s expense), and PayPal will generally require a Seller to accept the item back and refund the buyer the full purchase price plus original shipping costs. In the event a Seller loses a Claim, the Seller will not receive a refund on his or her PayPal fees associated with the transaction. If you are a Seller and you lose a SNAD Claim because the item you sold is counterfeit, you will be required to provide a full refund to the buyer and you will not receive the item back.</li> </ul> <p><strong>7.6 Digital Goods Micropayment Disputes and Claims</strong>.

If these are limited or if your purchase is not eligible for coverage, you will still be able to follow PayPal’s standard dispute resolution processes described in this Section 7 to attempt to resolve the issue with the Seller directly.</p> <p><strong>7.7 Relationship between PayPal's protection programs and Chargebacks.</strong>&nbsp;Credit card Chargeback rights, if they apply, may be broader than PayPal’s protection programs. Chargebacks may cover unsatisfactory items even if they do not qualify as SNAD. You may pursue a Dispute/Claim with PayPal, or you may contact your credit card company and pursue your Chargeback rights. You may not pursue both at the same time or seek a double recovery. If you have an open Dispute or Claim with PayPal, and also file a Chargeback with your credit card company, PayPal will close your Dispute or Claim, and you will have to rely solely on your Chargeback rights.</p> <p>Before contacting your card issuer or filing a Dispute with PayPal, you should contact the Seller to resolve your issue in accordance with the Seller’s return policy as stated on their auction or website.</p> <p><strong>7.8 Claims filed with Seller or other third parties.</strong>&nbsp;You may not file a Dispute/Claim under PayPal Buyer Protection if you have already filed a claim with the Seller or another third party (other than eBay).</p> <p><strong>7.9 No Double Recovery.</strong>&nbsp;You may not receive a recovery for a purchase under PayPal Buyer Protection if you have already received a recovery for that purchase directly from the Seller or another third party.</p>
