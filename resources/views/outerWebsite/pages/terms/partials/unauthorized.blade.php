<h3><a name="8" pa-marked="1"></a>8. Errors and Unauthorized Transactions.</h3> <p><strong>8.1 Protection for Unauthorized Transactions and Errors.</strong>&nbsp;When an Unauthorized Transaction or an Error occurs in your Account, PayPal will cover you for the full amount of every eligible Unauthorized Transaction or Error so long as you follow the procedures discussed below.</p> <p>An Unauthorized Transaction occurs when a payment is sent from your Account that you did not authorize and that did not benefit you. For example, if someone steals your password, uses the password to access your Account, and sends a payment from your Account, an Unauthorized Transaction has occurred. If you give someone access to your Account (by giving them your login information) and they conduct transactions without your knowledge or permission, you are responsible for any resulting use.</p> <p><strong>8.2 Notification Requirements.</strong></p> <p style="margin-left:24pt;">a. You should immediately notify PayPal if you believe:</p> <ul> <li style="margin-left: 48pt;">there has been an Unauthorized Transaction or unauthorized access to your Account;</li> <li style="margin-left: 48pt;">there is an Error in your Account history statement (you can access your Account history statement by logging into your Account and clicking on a link to “View all of my transactions” ) or in your transaction confirmation sent to you by email;</li> <li style="margin-left: 48pt;">your password or PayPal Mobile PIN has been compromised;</li> <li style="margin-left: 48pt;">your PayPal Mobile-activated phone has been lost, stolen or deactivated; or</li> <li style="margin-left: 48pt;">you need more information about a transaction listed on the statement or transaction confirmation.</li> </ul> <p style="margin-left:24pt;">b. To be eligible for protection for Unauthorized Transactions, you must notify us within 60 Days after any Unauthorized Transaction first appears in your Account history statement. We will extend the 60 Day time period if a good and demonstrable reason, such as a hospital stay, kept you from notifying us within 60 Days.<br> <br> You should regularly log into your Account and review your Account history statement to ensure that there has not been an Unauthorized Transaction or Error. PayPal will also send an email to the primary email address you have provided in order to notify you of each transaction from your Account. You should also review these transaction confirmations to ensure that each transaction was authorized and is accurate.</p> <p>For Unauthorized Transactions or Errors in your Account, notify us as follows:</p> <ul> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;"><a href="https://www.paypal.com/et/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_complaint-view&amp;nav=0.4" pa-marked="1"><strong>Use this form</strong></a>&nbsp;to file a report in the PayPal Resolution Center; or</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">Write to PayPal, Attn: Error Resolution Department, P.O. Box 45950, Omaha, NE 68145-0950; or</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">Call PayPal Customer Service at (402) 935-7733 (in the U.S.).</li> </ul> <p>When you notify us, provide us with all of the following information:</p> <ul> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">Your name and email address registered to your Account;</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">A description of any suspected Unauthorized Transaction or Error and an explanation as to why you believe it is incorrect or why you need more information to identify the transaction; and</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">The amount of any suspected Unauthorized Transaction or Error.</li> </ul> <p>If you notify us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 Business Days. During the course of our investigation, we may request additional information from you.</p> <p><strong>8.3 PayPal Actions after Receipt of Your Notification.</strong>&nbsp;Once you notify us of any suspected Unauthorized Transaction or Error, or we otherwise learn of one, we will do the following:</p> <ul> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">We will conduct an investigation to determine whether there has been an Unauthorized Transaction or Error that is eligible for protection.</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">We will complete our investigation within 10 Business Days of the date we received your notification of the suspected Unauthorized Transactions or Error. If your Account is new (the first transaction from your Account was less than 30 Business Days from the date you notify us), we may take up to 20 Business Days to complete this investigation. If we need more time, we may take up to 45 Days to complete our investigation (or up to 90 Days for new Accounts, or if your transaction was at a point of sale where you were physically present, or a foreign initiated transaction).</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">If we decide that we need more time to complete our investigation, we will provisionally credit your Account for the amount of the suspected Unauthorized Transaction or Error. You will receive the provisional credit within 10 Business Days of the date we received your notice (or 20 Business Days for new Accounts). This will allow you to have use of the money until we complete the investigation. We will notify you of the provisional credit within 2 Business Days of the crediting. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 Business Days (or 20 Business Days for new Accounts), we will not provisionally credit your Account.</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">We will inform you of our decision within 3 Business Days after completing our investigation.</li> </ul> <p style="margin-left:24pt;">If we determine that there was an Unauthorized Transaction or Error, we will promptly credit the full amount into your Account within 1 Business Day of our determination. Or, if you have already received a provisional credit, you will be allowed to retain those amounts.<br> <br> If we decide that there was not an Unauthorized Transaction or Error, we will include an explanation of our decision in our email to you. If you received a provisional credit, we will remove it from your Account and notify you of the date and amount of the debit. You may request copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.</p> <p><strong>8.4 PayPal Errors.</strong>&nbsp;We will rectify any Error that we discover. If the Error results in your receipt of less than the correct amount to which you are entitled, PayPal will credit your Account for the difference. If the Error results in your receipt of more than the correct amount to which you are entitled, PayPal will debit the extra funds from your Account.</p> <p><strong>8.5 Your Errors.</strong>&nbsp;If you erroneously send a payment to the wrong party, or send a payment for the wrong amount (based on a typographical error, for example), your only recourse will be to contact the party to whom you sent the payment and ask them to refund the payment. PayPal will not reimburse you or reverse a payment that you have made in error.</p>
