Account Balances.</h3> <p><strong>4.1 Balances.</strong>&nbsp;If you hold a balance, PayPal will hold your funds in pooled accounts separate from its corporate funds, and it will not use your funds for its operating expenses or for any other corporate purposes. PayPal will not voluntarily make your funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. You will not receive interest or other earnings on the amounts in your balance. PayPal may receive interest on amounts that PayPal holds on your behalf. You agree to assign your rights to PayPal for any interest derived from your funds.</p> <p><strong>4.2 Setoff of Past Due Amounts.</strong>&nbsp;If you have a past due amount owed to PayPal, an Affiliate, or eBay PayPal may debit your Account to pay any amounts that are more than 180 Days past due.</p> <p><strong>4.3 Negative Balances and Multiple Currencies.</strong>&nbsp;If your Account has a negative balance, PayPal may set-off the negative balance with any funds that you subsequently add or receive into your Account. If you have multiple currency balances in your Account and one of the currency balances becomes negative for any reason, PayPal may set-off the negative balance by using funds you maintain in a different currency balance. If you open more than one Account, PayPal may set off the negative balance in one Account by using any balance that you maintain in your other Account(s). In the event that a negative balance is offset by PayPal pursuant to this paragraph, it may be bundled with another debit coming out of your Account.</p>
