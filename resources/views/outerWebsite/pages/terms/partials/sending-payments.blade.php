<p><strong>2.1 Sending Limits.</strong>&nbsp;We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of payments you can send through the PayPal Services. You can view your sending limit, if any, by logging into your Account. If you have a Verified Account, we may increase your sending limits.</p><p><strong>2.2 Default Payment Methods.</strong>&nbsp;When you make a payment, if you have not selected a Preferred Payment Method, PayPal will fund your transaction in this order (subject to availability based on your Payment Methods and country/region of registration):</p><ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">Balance</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">Instant Transfer from your bank account</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">Debit card</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">Credit card</li> <li style="margin-left: 24pt;">eCheck</li> </ol><p style="margin-left:21.0pt;">In certain countries, You may be able nominate a Preferred Payment Method in your Account Profile or select a Preferred Payment Method each time you make a payment, except for a Preapproved Payment.</p><p style="margin-left:21.0pt;">For a Preapproved Payment in these countries, you can select a Preferred Payment Method when you provide your initial authorization for this payment and through the My Preapproved Payments section of your Account Profile.</p><p style="margin-left:21.0pt;">PayPal may limit the Payment Methods available for a transaction. Some Payment Methods may not be available in certain circumstances, including:</p><ul> <li>American Express may not be available as a Payment Method for certain merchants, such as branded airlines and certain travel merchants;</li> <li>Some credit cards may not be available as a Payment Method for certain merchants, such as those in the gambling industry; and</li> <li>Credit cards cannot be used to send Personal Payments or to top up your PayPal balance.</li> </ul><p>If the Preferred Payment Method fails (for example, a credit card or debit card expires) and your PayPal account cannot complete a transaction, it may be used again to try to complete the transaction. If the Preferred Payment Method in your PayPal account cannot complete a transaction after repeated attempts, each of the other payment methods available in your PayPal account may be used to try to complete the transaction.</p><p><strong>2.3 Cards as Payment Methods.</strong>&nbsp;By adding a debit card or credit card as a Payment Method, you are providing PayPal with continuous authority to automatically charge that card to obtain the relevant funds when the card is used as a Payment Method pursuant to this Agreement. You can stop the continuous authority in respect of any card by removing that card as a Payment Method in your Account Profile.</p><p><strong>2.4 Preferred Payment Method.</strong>&nbsp;You may select a Preferred Payment Method each time you make a payment, except for a Preapproved Payment or a No Log-In Payment.</p><p>For a Preapproved Payment and, in most instances, a No Log-In Payment, you can select a Preferred Payment Method when you provide your initial authorization for this payment and through the My Preapproved Payments section of your Account Profile.</p><p>If eCheck is your Preferred Payment Method, it will be used to fund your PayPal payment, even if you have a balance.</p><p><strong>2.5 Refused and Refunded Payments. </strong>When you send a payment, the recipient is not required to accept it. Any unclaimed, refunded or denied payment will be returned to your balance or to your original Payment Method. We will return any unclaimed payment to you within 30 Days of the date you initiated the payment.</p><p>When you send a payment online using PayPal and the transaction is ultimately refunded, the money will be refunded to the original payment method you used for the transaction if you used a debit card, credit card or PayPal balance. If you used a bank account as the payment method for the transaction, we will refund the money to your bank account, or to your PayPal balance if we cannot refund it to your bank account.</p><p>When you buy something from a seller using PayPal that required a currency conversion and a refund is issued by the Seller using PayPal:</p><ul> <li>Within 1 day of the date of the original payment, the transaction exchange rate used at the time of the original payment will apply.</li> </ul><ul> <li>Beyond 1 day of the date of the original payment, the transaction exchange rate (including the applicable currency conversion fee as set out in section 4 of Exhibit A) on the date of the refund will apply.&nbsp; The transaction exchange rate may be applied immediately and without notice to you. This means that you may not receive the full amount of your original payment due to the fees above and fluctuations in currency conversion rates.</li> </ul><p><strong>2.6 Merchant Processing Delay.</strong>&nbsp;When you send a payment to certain Merchants, you are providing an Authorization to the Merchant to process your payment and complete the transaction. The payment will be held as pending until the Merchant processes your payment. Some Merchants may delay processing your payment. In such an instance, your Authorization will remain valid for up to 30 Days. If your payment requires a currency conversion, the exchange rate will be determined at the time the Merchant processes your payment and completes the transaction.</p><p><strong>2.7 Preapproved Payments.</strong>&nbsp;A Preapproved Payment is a payment in which you Authorize a Merchant to directly charge your Account on a one-time, regular, or sporadic basis. Preapproved Payments are sometimes called "subscriptions", "recurring payments”, “preauthorized transfers” or "automatic payments". Within two (2) Business Days of any Preapproved Payment made from your Account, you will receive a confirmation of this transaction by email.</p><ol start="1" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"> <li><strong>Notice for Certain Preapproved Payments.</strong>&nbsp;If a Preapproved Payment will vary in amount and is made using an Instant Transfer, eCheck, debit card Payment Method or your PayPal balance, you have the right to advance notice of the amount and date of the transfer from the Merchant at least 10 Days before the transfer is made. If the Merchant provides the option, you may choose to receive this advance notice only when the amount of your Preapproved Payment will fall outside a range established between you and the Merchant. This notice is designed to protect you from having insufficient funds in your bank account to cover the Preapproved Payment.</li> </ol><p><strong>2.8 Stopping a Preapproved Payment.</strong>&nbsp;You may stop a Preapproved Payment at any time up to 3 Business Days prior to the date the next payment is scheduled to be made by notifying PayPal. To stop a Preapproved Payment, access the "My Preapproved Payments" section of your Account Profile and follow the links to stop the payment. You may also stop a Preapproved Payment by calling PayPal at 1-402-935-2050 (in the U.S.). Once you contact PayPal to stop a Preapproved Payment, all future payments under your agreement with the Merchant will be stopped. If you stop a Preapproved Payment you may still be liable to the Merchant for the payment or for other penalties under the terms of your agreement with the Merchant and you may be required to pay the Merchant through alternative means. We will be liable for your losses or damages directly caused by our failure to stop any Preapproved Payment if you have followed the instructions in this section to notify us.</p>
